# Carbon-Emission-for-Sustainable-decision-making
Analyzed global CO₂ emissions data using SQL for querying and Python for EDA and visualization. Identified top polluting countries and sectors, compared renewable vs non-renewable emissions, and explored GDP-emission correlations. Delivered insights through Jupyter notebooks and structured SQL queries.



**Description:**

This project explores global carbon emissions trends and patterns using a combination of **SQL for data querying** and **Python (Jupyter Notebooks) for exploratory data analysis and visualization**. The goal was to extract meaningful insights about CO₂ emissions across countries, sectors, and energy types, helping inform sustainable decision-making.

**Key Contributions:**

* Analyzed emissions by **country, sector, and energy type** using optimized SQL queries.
* Conducted time series trends to identify **top polluters and emission growth** over years.
* Compared **renewable vs non-renewable energy impacts** on CO₂ output.
* Correlated **GDP with emissions** to evaluate economic-environmental impact.
* Created intuitive **visualizations** in Python to support data storytelling.

**Tech Stack:**

* **SQL:** PostgreSQL-style queries for deep insights
* **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

**Outcome:** Delivered a well-documented, insight-rich project that demonstrates strong data analysis, SQL querying, and visualization skills—ideal for sustainability-focused analytics roles.
